[Ritual neo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHuQWPtaw8XLRMIOctBQRQ) was the one who requested this tools construction <br />This was made to save time manualy assigning blendshapes to the Blendshape Avatar <br /> 

This tool is not a silver bullet and has some edge cases that the tool will not work with <br /> I am looking into fixing these issues

## Notes
* Your input blendshapes must be named according to vrchat / arkit naming conventions
* If the tool fails to make the file delete the files the tool generated and try again
* Please verify your avatar. Some avatars have weird/unconventional names for blendshapes
